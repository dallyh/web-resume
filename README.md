# Welcome to my [Resume](https://resume.daliborhon.com)

This page was created as a fun project of mine, trying to learn something more about web development, and get better with my coding skills. In the beginning I decided to use ASP.NET Core Razor Pages (because I have experience with C#) with combination of Blazor components. Later on I found out that ASP.NET is a little bit overkill for such a simple website, so I switched to static site generator called Astro. Of cource plain JavaScript (later on TypeScript) and other standard tools and languages had to be used as well. When I initially started, I did not have much experience with web development, so this project tool longer than I expected. Anyways it was a great journey, and now I can say that I know a lot more than before. And what's better? I enjoyed it!

Initially I started with a template called Start Bootstrap (Licensed under MIT), because as I mentioned I did not have any previous experience on writing plain HTML and using CSS. Using Bootstrap seemed like a good decision. In the process I figured out that I wasnâ€™t really learning on how to create a website, I was learning on how to use Bootstrap. That is why I decided to not use it anymore, and focus more on learning the "basics" first.
